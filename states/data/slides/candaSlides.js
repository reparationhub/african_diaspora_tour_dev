        When Canadians talk about slavery, they often point with pride to the
        role their country played as a safe haven for Americans escaping
        captivity via the Underground Railroad.
        <br />
        <br />
        This, however, is only half the story. Like the United States, Britian,
        South America and Caribbean Canada has its own history of slavery, a
        history we should never forget.

        Slavery in what is now Canada predates the arrival of Europeans, with
        some Indigenous peoples enslaving prisoners taken in war. Europeans
        brought a different kind of slavery to North America, however. Europeans
        viewed slavery in racial terms, with Indigenous and African people
        serving and white people ruling as masters.

        The colony of New France, founded in the early 1600s, was the first
        major settlement in what is now Canada. Slavery was a common practice in
        the territory.
        <br />
        <br />
        When New France was conquered by the British in 1759, records revealed
        that approximately 3,600 enslaved had lived in the settlement since its
        beginnings. The vast majority of them were Indigenous but Black enslaved
        people were also present because of the transatlantic slave trade.

        Slavery continued after the British conquest of New France in 1763. The
        territory was eventually renamed British North America, and black
        enslaved people came to replace Indigenous enslaved people.
        <br />
        <br />
        Compared to the United States, enslaved people made up a much smaller
        proportion of the It would be wrong, however, to suggest that enslaved
        people in British North America were well treated.

        African Americans escape from enslavement in the American South to to
        free Northern states or to Canada. After the war, about 3,000 Black fled
        to Canada - then British North America - on the promise of freedom and a
        farm. Most were given access to rocky, hardscrabble lots often on the
        worst soil- in the maritime province of Nova Scotia.
        <br />
        <br />
        But they weren't given the ownership white settlers received. To this
        day, the descendants of runaway slaves from America live on land that is
        theirs but they do not not legally own. To this day, the fight continues
        for land owneship by African Canadians.
