        Those first Africans who landed in the US were destined for a life of
        servitude. They were sold or traced to wealthy plantation owners in
        Hampton or sent to a settlement on the James River. They had to work the
        crop, the corn fields, the tobacco fields.
        <br />
        <br />
        Africans had no official status in the American colonies until
        Massachusetts became the first to legalize slavery in 1641.

        While those in the South held more slaves to tend labor intensive crops,
        many whites in the more industrialized, urban North kept slaves as
        domestic servants or skilled laborers. And though Northern states
        abolished slavery some of them gradually they still profited from the
        institution.

        Life for most enslaved men and women was brutal and harsh. As slavery
        expanded in the Lower South in the early 19th century, legal codes
        governing the behavior of enslaved men and women became more harsh.
        Punishments for infractions were severe. Whipping was prescribed for
        minor offenses, and branding, mutilation, and even death were employed
        as punishment for more serious As the nineteenth century progressed,
        many abolitionists united to form numerous antislavery societies.

        Slavery in the US was eventually abolished 1865. Blacks continue to
        fight for equal rights in the US.

        The enslavement of Black people in the United States created wealth,
        opportunity, and prosperity for millions of Americans. As American
        slavery evolved, an elaborate and enduring mythology about the
        inferiority of Black people was created to legitimate, perpetuate, and
        defend slavery.
        <br />
        <br />
        This mythology survived slaverys formal abolition following the Civil
        War.
