        The East African slave trade was also enormous in size and equally
        horrible compared to the Atlantic slave trade. Less slaves perished
        during the sea transport in the Dhows as the transport lasted fewer days
        than on the Atlantic trade. However large numbers of slaves perished
        when walking (often carrying ivory tusks or other goods) from the
        interior to the East African harbours for transport. During the 16th and
        17th century the East African slave-trade was controlled by the
        Portuguese with African and Arab support. The Omani Arabs controlled the
        slave-trade during the 18th and 19th century with Zanzibar being the
        main slave-market. Smaller slave markets existed in places like Muscat
        and Mukalla.

        Between 1850 and 1873 at least 173000 slaves were sold via Zanzibar.
        According Wellsted around 4000 slaves were dispatched annually through
        the Muscat slave market in the 1830´s.
        <br />
        <br />
        It is estimated that well over 1.6 million slaves were traded from East
        Africa during the 19th century. The Arab slave trade was actively
        discouraged and contained by the British (see several of the treaties
        and the hunting for slave dhows by the British Navy) .
        <br />
        <br />
        With plentiful very cheap and flexible labourers (coolies) from India
        this also became economically possible for the British.

        After the first world-war the Germans were kicked out of East Africa by
        the British. In 1906 the banker Bernard Dernburg became head of the
        colonial office. Albert Rechenberg became governor. Measures to treat
        the black population with more respect were introduced. However the main
        focus as to make the colony more economically viable. The increasing
        arrival of German settlers resulted in conflicts regarding
        landownership. The Germans introduced major improvements in
        infrastructure including railway connections and also started education
        programs for the local children. After the first world-war the colony
        was taken over by the British. During the complete period of its
        existence the German colony had never been economically viable.

        Of particular interest was the role of Tippu Tip: Just like an Omani
        Arab guided in the 15th century Vasco da Gama to Asia it was Tippu Tip
        who guided Livingstone and others to the interior of East Africa. Tippu
        Tip was also the most important (and richest) slave and ivory trader of
        East Africa in the 19th century. Apart from the British also the Germans
        made keenly use of his influence and services..... His fascinating
        memoirs were translated from Swahili into German and published by the
        German Heinrich Brode.

        Regarding slavery in Oman. In 1900 in his book "Cradle of Islam" p 85
        S.M Zwemer writes: The town of Sur (in Oman) has always been a place of
        trade and enterprise and its buggalows visit India, Zanzibar and the
        Persian Gulf. The people are all bold sailors since many generations.
        But Sur also has the unenviable reputation of being now the centre of
        illicit slave-trading" During 1884 and 1902 the (large scale) traffic in
        slaves increased somewhat as many slaving ships operated under the
        French flag (!!), which was rather indiscriminately granted to various
        Arab and Indian Ocean captains.
