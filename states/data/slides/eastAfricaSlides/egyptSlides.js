        By the third/ninth century, slaves in Egypt were mostly born into
        slavery or were the captives of slavers who imported them from outside
        the Realm of Islam. Other forms of enslavement that had been licit in
        the eyes of legal authorities in the late first/seventh and
        second/eighth century, such as bonded labor to work off debts, are not
        recorded to have found the support of third/ninth-century and later
        Egyptian jurists.

        The ancient Egyptians were black Africans, displaced by later movements
        of peoples, for example the Macedonian, Roman and Arab conquests. The
        Nubians were first targeted for slavery. Ancient Nubians are an
        ethno-linguistic group of people who are indigenous to the region which
        is now present-day Northern Sudan and southern Egypt.

        Slavery in the region of the Sudan has a long history. Slavery and the
        State Slavery in different eras of the history of the Sudan was a state
        affair, whether it was the ancient kingdoms, the nineteenth-century
        TurcoEgyptian, or the national government of Mahdiyya that succeeded the
        Turco-Egyptian rule in 1885. The Anglo-Egyptian government (the
        Condominium) that was established in 1899 by an agreement between
        Britain and Egypt, which left the British the de facto rulers of the
        Sudan, danced around the issue of slavery for a long time.

        Although it was private individuals who raided innocent villagers in the
        Nuba Mountains, South Sudan, and Southern Darfur to capture slaves, the
        sultans and kings of ancient and medieval kingdoms invariably got the
        lion’s share of the hunt. Slaves were sought to fulfill gender roles,
        men for the army and women for domestic labor and sexual pleasure. The
        Turco-Egyptian invaders eyed the Sudan for strong men to serve in the
        empire’s army and embarked on state-funded raids to get them., The
        Turco-Egyptian conquest of Nilotic Sudan (1820–1822) had its express
        purpose the acquisition of slaves to serve as soldiers in the new modern
        army envisioned by the Egyptian ruler, Muhammad Ali.

        Although most Egyptian slavers must have operated outside the Realm of
        Islam or kidnapped people during punitive campaigns against Nubia or the
        Buja, they also enslaved their fellow Egyptian. Similarly referring to
        enslavement on Egyptian soil and the vulnerability of dark-skinned
        people, a story in Kitāb ʿajāʾib al-Hind, the core of which must date to
        the fourth/tenth century suggests that a black African travelling along
        the Nile without company (and social protection) was imagined to be a
        slaver’s likely prey.
