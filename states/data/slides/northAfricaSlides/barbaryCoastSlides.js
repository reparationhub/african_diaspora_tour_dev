        Piracy became an important source of slaves for the Roman Empire and in
        the 5th century AD pirates of Barbary would raid coastal North African
        villages and enslave the capture. Let’s examine the Barbary slave trade.

        The Barbary slave trade refers to slave markets on the Barbary Coast of
        North Africa, which included the Ottoman provinces of Algeria, Tunisia
        and Tripolitania and the independent sultanate of Morocco. Between the
        16th and middle of the 18th century, The Barbary Coast became well known
        as a corsair region.

        Corsairs were people who engaged in piracy in the early modern period.
        While mostly privateers, corsairs could also be pirates, the difference
        being that privateers were commissioned by governments and only had the
        authority to attack certain ships while pirates had their own agencies.

        By the early 17th century, Mediterranean trade was extremely profitable.
        Corsairing was quite common and was a successful and relatively easy way

        taken to the Americas: most would end their days as slaves in North
        Africa, dying of starvation, disease, or maltreatment.
