        The history of Africans in Latin America is multifaceted and complex.
        Not all Africans were slaves, and for those who were, conditions were
        diverse depending on a number of factors, such as economics, politics,
        ecology and demographics.
        <br />
        <br />
        Europeans in Latin America used African labour in every conceivable form
        in every place they settled during the colonial period and beyond.

        Slaves carried out a wide range of tasks. They were squires, muleteers,
        cowboys, blacksmiths, domestic servants, gold miners, pearl divers,
        sugar cane cultivators etc. As in other parts of South America, the
        indigenous population decreased dramatically as a result of the arrival
        of the Spaniards.
        <br />
        <br />
        To compensate for the loss of indigenous labour, African slaves were
        transported in great numbers to certain south american regions.

        In spite of the authorities efforts, slaves continued to rise up, revolt
        and abscond throughout the colonial period and beyond. The vast
        territories were impossible for slave owners and authorities to fully
        monitor. More importantly, perhaps, was the influence of the indigenous
        peoples means of resistance.

        The role of descendants of slaves in the building of the Panama Canal
        was enforced by the French who had previously built a railroad through
        Panama, linking the Atlantic to the Pacific, an undertaking that relied
        heavily on slave labour.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, the French never finished the canal, due to high death toll of
        workers. It is estimated that a total 22 K people died, a large number
        of whom were descendants of Africans.
