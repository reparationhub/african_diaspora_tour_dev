        Whilst slavery had no legal basis in England, the law was often
        misinterpreted. Black people previously enslaved in the colonies
        overseas and then brought to England by their owners, were often still
        treated as slaves.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some former believing this slaves got baptized would ensure their
        freedom. Others took advantage of being on English soil and absconded.
        Notices for runaway slaves featured in newspapers during this period.

        Some entrepreneurs brought slaves to Britain, where they were kept in
        bondage, branded and forced to hard labor much in the same way black
        slaves were forced to hard labor in cotton fields and plantations in
        British colonies in North America.

        trade in enslaved Africans. The clues to the history in places like

        Road or parish records and inscribed gravestones.

        The sugar plantations were key to creating Britain's most valuable
        colonies. By the end of the 18th century, Bristol, Glasgow and Liverpool
        had become major ports handling the cargoes brought back.
        <br />
        <br />
        Britain's slavery economy was enormous and extremely complex. It is
        clear that the economy benefited enormously from the exploitation of
        African slave labor in the Caribbean.
        <br />
        <br />
        Slavery and colonialism were intimately linked to the development of
        much of the financial infrastructure that enabled Britain to emerge as
        the economic and imperial global powerhouse of the nineteenth century.
