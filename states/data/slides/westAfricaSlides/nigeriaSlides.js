        The West African territory now known as Nigeria was first discovered in
        1472 by researchers from Portugal who were seeking a sea route to Asia.
        <br />
        <br />
        Their names were Joao de Santarem, Lopo Goncalves, Pero Escobar and
        Fernao do Po.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Portuguese were shocked to see established civilizations that
        rivalled those in Europe.

        An interesting fact is that the name 'Nigeria' was not given to the
        Nigerians themselves. However, by the European colonizers.
        <br />
        <br />
        Prior to this, the four main kingdoms that made up the country were
        Borno, Hausa in the north, Benin and Oyo in the south.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each had its own unique and artistic identity.

        Mainly driven by the goal of finding a suitable trade route with Asia,
        the Portuguese sailors actually discovered Nigeria by mistake.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The Portuguese wanted a shipping route that would make more economic
        sense and would be more cost-effective. However, when they arrived, they
        discovered that the land was very similar to theirs.

        As at 1471, Portuguese ships had ventured into the Niger Delta, although
        they did not know what it was at the time, they quickly encountered the
        Benin Kingdom, and were shocked at the opulence and level of wealth the
        land displayed.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 1481, emissaries from the King of Portugal visited the court of the
        Oba of Benin. This sparked the beginning of a long relationship between
        the Portuguese and people from Benin.

        The people of Benin welcomed the Portuguese with open arms, but that
        would become the downfall of the people.
        <br />
        <br />
        They maintained a good relationship, and the Portuguese even received
        payments for joining the people of Benin in wars. At a point, Portuguese
        even came to be spoken at the palace of the Oba of Benin.
        <br />
        <br />
        Gwatto, the port of Benin, became the depot for handling peppers, ivory
        and increasing numbers of slaves offered by the Oba in exchange for
        beads, textiles, tools and weapons.

        Despite the flourishing trade relationship, one state in the Benin
        Kingdom, 'Edo', was reluctant to be a part of the transatlantic slave
        trade. The Edo people believed that selling their brothers would have
        consequences on their land.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Portuguese took what they could get, and began to trade slaves on
        the Gold Coast. The port of Benin and the Gold Coast of Benin became
        famous for its trade in slaves, and this marked start of the movement of
        West Africans into the diaspora. This activity led to majority of Black
        people being disenfranchised and unware of their origins.
