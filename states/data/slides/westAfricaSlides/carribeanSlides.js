        The Caribbean is a region of islands and coastal territory in the
        Americas that is roughly defined by its interaction with the Caribbean
        Sea. The earliest interactions between Europeans and indigenous people
        in the New World took place in the Caribbean.

        Beginning in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, Europeans
        began to exploit the region for mineral and agricultural production,
        launching unprecedented demographic changes as indigenous people were
        systematically replaced with people of African origins.

        Africans were forcibly brought to British owned colonies in the
        Caribbean and sold as slaves to work on plantations.

        Those engaged in the trade were driven by the huge financial gain to be

        Enslaved people constantly rebelled against slavery right up until
        emancipation in 1834. Most spectacular were the slave revolts during the
        18th and 19th centuries, including: Tackys rebellion in 1760s Jamaica,
        the Haitian Revolution (1789), Fedon's 1790 revolution in Grenada, the
        1816 Barbados slave revolt led by Bussa, and the major 1831 slave revolt
        in Jamaica led by Sam Sharpe.

        The British slave trade officially ended in 1807, making the buying and
        selling of slaves from Africa illegal: however, slavery itself had not
        ended.
        <br />
        <br />
        Passed legislation brought about a period of apprenticeship with freedom
        coming in 1838. Even after the end of slavery and apprenticeship the
        Caribbean was not totally free. Former enslaved people received no
        compensation and had limited representation in government.
        <br />
        <br />
        Indentured labour from India and China was introduced after slavery.
        After indenture, Indians and Africans struggled to own land and create
        their own communities.
