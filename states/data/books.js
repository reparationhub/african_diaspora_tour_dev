        Due to waves of invasions and migrations spanning centuries, it can not
        be disputed that present-day Egyptians bear European features and DNA.

        that ancient Egyptians were black-skinned Africans. Scientists who
        continue to push the argument that ancient Egyptians were not related to
        sub-Saharan Africans are number one, ignoring the blatant facts, and
        number two, unable to find any DNA in the mummified remains that they
        studied. In fact, the mummified remains studied were not older than 1300
        B.C. Keep in mind that predynastic Egypt existed between 5000 - 3100 BC
        -- a period that was not covered in Scientific research. Indeed it was
        black-skinned Africans who were cursed of God in the bible story of the
        Ten Commandments. It was also the black-skinned Africans of ancient
        Egypt who were the leaders of the globe at one point in time and have
        contributed to the world many discoveries, ideas and philosophies such
        as the method of writing, paper, literature, art, architecture,
        religion, science, mathematics, geometry, surveying, metallurgy,
        astronomy, accounting, paper, medicine, the ramp, the lever, the plough,
        mills for grinding grain and all the paraphernalia that goes with large
        organized societies.{" "}

        Did you know that Columbus himself mentions being watched by people when
        he arrived in the Americas? Careful examination of historical facts
        proves that the people watching Columbus were black Africans and
        Indigenous people -- who were in the land long before Columbus arrived.
        Columbus himself also mentions returning to Europe (from the Americas)
        with spearheads made with gold (See photo). The spearheads in question
        bear a striking resemblance to the ones in West Africa. Columbus goes on
        to say that the spears were given to him by dark-skinned people in large
        boats.{" "}

      "Archaeological Evidence Africans were in the Americas before Columbus",

      <span>
        Olmec & Ife Heads were first discovered by Jose Melgar in 1862 in South
        & Central America. As you can see in the photos, the heads bear a
        striking resemblance to the African people. The heads stand
        approximately 11 feet tall and weigh around forty tons. It doesn't take
        a degree in archaeology to know that statues of any kind in any land
        point to honour. The status of Africans in central & south America,
        therefore, proves that Africans were respected, revered and more likely
        than not worshipped when they were there -- long before Columbus
        arrived. It is also worth noting that the helmets in the photos are very
        much similar to helmets worn in sub-Saharan Africa.{" "}
